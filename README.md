# the_grandmaster_idea

### Study the mathematics of a complex system par excellence and try to apply to these results the concepts already widely used in mathematics such as the entropy of a function h[f] (also used in theoretical physics for black holes at the beginning of history) in search of a fundamental axiom from which to coherently build general relativity and quantum field theory.
The game of chess is probably one of the most complex board games to describe mathematically and with an enormous number of possible combinations. Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain and this project bears his name.

## What the_grandmaster_idea is not
* a software to establish the best chess game
* a way to discover all possible playable games
* yet another chess software

## What the_grandmaster_idea is
* all the rest

## A bit of history
This project started a long time ago. The initial inspiration came from reading a scientific article by Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose about the thermodynamics of black holes and the definition of a black hole's entropy. Quantum theory and quantum gravity, in particular, hypothesize the existence of infinite infinitesimal bits of information that interacting with each other allow the universe to exist as we know it (if we really know it). In any case, the concept of entropy and all the thermodynamics of black holes is based on this hypothesis even at the moment it is completely indemonstrable with current technology. However, extensive research has led me to think that the same models and definitions of entropy can be used to study complex systems on a large scale.
It is very interesting to note that Hilbert's sixth problem, in a sense, aims at the same goal: to axiomatize the areas of physics in which mathematics is prevalent. It is precisely the quantum theory of fields and general relativity that seem, at the moment, irreconcilable but both are based on solid mathematical foundations and would be impossible to describe without the use of particular mathematical tools such as operators and tensors.
Now, perhaps, the project will appear clearer: study the mathematics of a complex system par excellence and try to apply to these results the concepts already widely used in mathematics such as the entropy of a function h[f] (also used in theoretical physics for black holes at the beginning of history) in search of a fundamental axiom from which to coherently build general relativity and quantum field theory.
